## Chapter 1 

Once there were two animals called Leon the tiger and Pepa the peacock. They were very close friends. They lived in a zoo. One day they were playing a game and loads of people came to them and looked at them. Leon and Pepa were both hearing "ooowww they playing  i have never seen a peacock and a tiger play, normaly the tiger eats the peacock heehee". Leon and Pepa were saying "Why are you looking at us weired? OK lets do a cute pose maybe Tiger Swift will see us on TikTok you never know!". At the end of the day when all the people left and they were playing before dinner they were just speaking about how weired that was because every single day they do that and none of the people were so "ooowww they are so cute" they had never done that so as soon as they called "dinner time" they quickly ran to the table for dinner. After dinner they had one more play time and then about 30 mins later they said "bed time!" so they quickly ran to bed.

## Chapter 2

The next morning Pepa said "good morning how are you?" to Leon "umm good thank you". They both got their breakfast and got back in their cages and people started coming in and doing the same thing, but to diffrent animals in the zoo, they could speak to but they just looked shy they did not like it at all because it was the koala they was doing it to only one animal got a bit of attention and that was the hippo potamas he was hidding his self under his muddy brown mud and he did not like it at all. By the afternoon the zoo had a 10 min break because they liked people coming in but they did not like them taking pictures though and they did not normally have to do that also after people came back in they had to wait in the queue because the done a check of their bags and took their phones to and they done a bag check so that there was not a single picture thing yo be seen. They took all of them but gave it all back at the end.

## Chapter 3 

The next day they all had an INSET day so the went on a special air plane to visit another zoo, Pepa and Leon said if they made new friends on the trip, they wont get mad at each other and made some rules:

1.Not be mad at each other because they were BFFs
2.They would all play together and have fun
3.BE KKKKKKKKKKKKKKIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD AAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNDDDDDD HHHHAAAAAVVVVEEE  FFFFFUUUUUMNNNNNNN TTTOOGGEETTHHEERR!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They all had fun on the plane and as quick as a blink of an eye they were there. As soon as the got to the zoo they all said "Hi" and straight away they made lots of new friends. When Leon was at the front of the line for lunch and Pepa was at the back Leon saved two seats, one his new friend Susen and one for Pepa. Susen the panda sat next to Leon but Pepa sat next to her new friend Carla far far away from Susen and Leon. Leon was really sad and ran to the bathroom then Pepa followed her to make sure he was ok, but he was crying and sobing that his BFF sat next to her new friend and not her! On the way back Pepa was trying to make Leon happy but she was not and he was silent. At the end the were bfffffffffffffffffs forever.
