They left at 6:00Am.They both had to get a taxi to London bridge station to get a train to Gatwick Airport so they then  got on the train and went to gatwick.

After quickly going through security they found out that the plane was delayed because of a storm. So they had to wait an extra hour for the flight. Cutie was happy because she didn't want to fly in the rain.  After an hour the storm has passed and there sunny spells so cutie was feeling  relaxed.They both boarded the plane and sat down in their seats which were 54 and 53. They got some snacks to eat and put their pjs on and fell asleep.
