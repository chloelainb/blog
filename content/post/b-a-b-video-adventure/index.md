This is my first stop motion movie that i did on my tablet. Its about two B-A-Bs [wich stands for build a bears]and one of them is waiting for they're friend and they're BFF comes so they had a little ride around but then comes this toy and they chase it until it just dissapears. To me this is around a an 9.5/10 it is good but not perfect.
